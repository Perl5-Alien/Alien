0.93 Mon Sep 14, 2015
  - Completely restored the original text for "ORIGINAL MANIFESTO".
    I removed the reference to Module::Build (MB), as it is not well
    regarded by the Perl toolchain developers.  Although not intended by
    me, it was suggested that it could seem a little sneaky.  Instead I
    have restored the original text in that section, and added a caveat
    that MB seems to work well for Alien distrobutions, but is no longer
    universally preferred to ExtUtils::MakeMaker (EUMM).
  - Added another caveat about Windows and Alien::MSYS
  - Made some grammar tweaks/fixes that were apparent when I read the
    documentation out loud.

0.92 Wed Sep 10 2015
  - Update documentation to reflect the past decade of actual
    Alien development.
  - Include links to #native IRC channel and Alien::Base mailing list
